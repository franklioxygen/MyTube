# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

See `../ICONS.md` for instructions on creating icons.

## Quick Option

You can use the MyTube favicon as a base:
1. Copy `../../frontend/public/favicon.png`
2. Resize to the required sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Save in this directory with the appropriate names

## Testing Without Icons

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default extension icon. The functionality is not dependent on custom icons.
